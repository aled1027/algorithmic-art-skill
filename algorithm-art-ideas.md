| # | Concept | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Flow Field Landscape** | Particles follow Perlin noise-driven vector fields, creating organic, wind-like patterns that evoke rolling hills or ocean currents |
| 2 | **Recursive Tree Generator** | L-system inspired branching structures with randomized angles, lengths, and colors—producing unique botanical forms each time |
| 3 | **Voronoi Stained Glass** | Dynamically generated Voronoi diagrams with gradient fills and dark edges, mimicking cathedral windows |
| 4 | **Particle Galaxy** | Thousands of particles orbiting a central attractor with gravitational physics, forming spiral arm structures |
| 5 | **Generative Topography** | Layered contour lines derived from noise functions, creating abstract mountain range maps with elevation coloring |
| 6 | **Geometric Tessellation** | Interlocking shapes (triangles, hexagons, or Penrose tiles) with procedural color harmonies and subtle animations |
| 7 | **Audio-Reactive Waveforms** | Sine waves, Lissajous curves, and interference patterns that can respond to interactive frequency parameters |
| 8 | **Brush Stroke Simulator** | Simulated paint strokes with varying pressure, opacity, and texture—building up abstract expressionist compositions |
| 9 | **Cellular Automata Patterns** | Conway's Game of Life or custom rule sets rendered with color trails, showing emergent complexity from simple rules |
| 10 | **Fractal Flame Renderer** | Iterated function systems generating the intricate, luminous structures seen in classic fractal flame art |
